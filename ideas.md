# Ideas

- slider to make color range wider or more narrow (within limits, semantics still need to hold up)
- slider to make background colors more or less intense ("soggyness"? as in "the cereals started diluting into the milk"?)
- accent chooser for background color tint? ("orange juice", "milk", "cocoa", "grape juice", "plain")
- CLI
- dynamic favicon, changes according to first accent color
- dynamic heading colors, using 4 accent colors for the "o" letters

# TODO

- [x] trim down shiki bundle size, trim themes, only few languages
- [x] store state in URL so that people can share / bookmark their config

* rename "juice" to "fruit"
* update docs
* tweak full-white/full-black color clipping
* tree shaking for culori
* plausible tracking
* add rust code sample
* publish that thing!
