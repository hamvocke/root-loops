# Ideas

- slider to make color range wider or more narrow (within limits, semantics still need to hold up)
- slider to make background colors more or less intense ("soggyness"? as in "the cereals started diluting into the milk"?)
- accent chooser for background color tint? ("orange juice", "milk", "cocoa", "grape juice", "plain")
- CLI
- dynamic favicon, changes according to first accent color
- dynamic heading colors, using 4 accent colors for the "o" letters
